# asus-ul30vt-backlight

This was modified from the keyboard backlight scripts for some other ASUS laptops. The current version allows 8 light levels with the min level being backlight off.

On Ubuntu and derivatives these files should be copied to the /etc/acpi/ folder then run sudo service acpid restart
